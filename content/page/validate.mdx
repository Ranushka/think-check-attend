          ### EVENT DISCOVERY SOURCE


          The first thing to consider when evaluating a conference is where and
          how it is

          promoted – and more importantly, how did you learn about it?


          <CheckerQuestion answersList={["friends or colleagues informed
          me|5|good trend just make sure that they stand by it", "I saw a paid
          advert online|2", "social media timeline|2", "mentioned by a trusted
          organisation|2", "mentioned by a trusted social media account|1|if its
          shared by a your known friend its much better", "listserve
          notification / member's organisation notification|2", "website /
          google search|2", "unsolicited email from a stranger|-5"]}
          isCheckbox={true} question="How did you hear about the event?" />


          > If you or a colleague received an unsolicited email from a contact
          you do not know (ie not an email from a listserv or membership
          organisation you are registered with) this is a huge red flag and sign
          of a potentially predatory event.


          *If you receive one of these emails and do not know the organisation
          or sender or cannot verify the existence of the organisation or
          individual sender, then this is concerning. Equally, if the
          organisation or individual sender are not actively producing research
          in the subject field of the event, or if the subject field of the
          event is not directly linked with your own research field, this is
          also a point of concern. Finally, be wary if there is a reference to a
          random (possibly unrelated) article you have published – as often
          predators find potential victims by collecting the contact details for
          corresponding authors from all recently published issues.*


          *So if you receive one of these emails, consider the following:*


          * *Can you identify and verify the sender, and are they actively
          producing research in your subject area?*

          * *Is the event relevant to their subject area and your own?*

          * *Is there is a clear and convincing rationale for you to be
          contacted?*

          * *Whether the email accurately highlights the relevance of the event
          to your field of study*

          * *Is the email tone overly flattering?*

        content: "### ORGANISER CREDIBILITY\n\nWhen evaluating a conference, it is important to consider the reputation of the conference organiser. Is the event organised by a reputable academic or professional institution, are you familiar with the individual organisers and their work, are you actually able to identify the organising institution and individual organisers, and are they active in the subject field related to the event?\n\n#### ORGANISER DETAILS\n\nWhile you wont always know everyone organising every conference in your field, it is important to be able to identify some key facts relating to the organisers, in order to ensure the event is legitimate.\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Can you verify that the organising institution and main organiser actually exist\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Can you identify the organising institution(s) or company/ies\" answersList={[\"yes|20\", \"no|-20\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"What type of organisation are they?\" answersList={[\"university\", \"society\", \"funder\", \"governmental\", \"commercial conference organiser\"]} />\n\nCan you identify where the organising institution is based, and is there an\nindependent record of their existence in this location\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Can you locate it on google maps\" answersList={[\"yes|25\", \"no|-25\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Does it look like a credible location for an organisation of this nature?\" answersList={[\"yes|25\", \"no|-25\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Do they have a website and/or social media presence\" answersList={[\"yes|25\", \"no|-25\"]} />\n\n#### ORGANISER REPUTATION\n\nIt is important to check whether the organiser really exists, and seems credible and active in your field – not only publishing but also engaging on social media with key accounts in your field and affiliated fields.\_\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Can you verify that the organiser is active in your field\_\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Do you, or someone you trust, know this organisation\_\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"does the organiser host lots of events in this field\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n*When evaluating the organising committee, it is not enough to just see names on a website.

      - title: EVENT
        content: "### EVENT CREDIBILITY\n\nWhen considering whether to attend an event, in addition to the event’s relevance to you and alignment with your own research interests, it is important to also think about the legitimacy and quality. Does it seem like the key motivation and purpose for organising the conference is to advance knowledge or make money, can you easily identify partners and venues, and is there transparency about funding sources?\_\n\n#### EVENT DETAILS\n\nA conference website might look glossy and seem legitimate, including a glamorous venue and lots of presenters with big shiny titles, but closer inspection can often reveal that the conference is a sham.  Therefore, it is important to look at some of the key features of the proposed event, to help you identify whether it is right for you.\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"can you identify the venue, and confirm its existence\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"can you find mentions of the event elsewhere by other organisations and  individuals (on social media and personal websites)\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n\nWhen looking at the website, consider whether it is good quality, informative and transparent. A bad website might not be a sign of an untrustworthy event, as not everyone has the funds to hire a professional website developer – so also pay attention to the quality and extent of the information provided.\n\n* Consider the quality of the website (visuals, language, layout)\n* Consider the transparency of information (organiser type, event costs, funding sources, sponsors and partners)\n* If you have time, check and see if sponsors, partners, and venue confirm their involvement in the event (on their own websites or social media accounts)\n* Consider the level of information provided: can you easily find information about the programme, the speakers, the venue, accommodation, transport, costs and refund policies\n* Is it easy to contact the organiser and do they provide helpful responses in a timely manner\n\n#### EVENT THEME\n\nThe theme and title of the conference should always be an important factor in your decision-making process. Part of this decision will be based on subjective factors, such as whether you think the event looks interesting and offers opportunities for you to learn relevant new developments in your field which align with your research. However there are also some objective factors related to the title and theme that can help you assess the legitimacy of the event.\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Does the event have a clear topic or theme?\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Which of the below best reflects the theme \" answersList={[\"broad and generic\", \"detailed and specific\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"does the event offer a clear and identifiable contribution to your field\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Do the keynote speakers exist, and is their work relevant to the event theme and wider field (and to your own research field)\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n*blurb on broad themed events to attract lots of people, don’t care about specific theme – of course sometimes want to invite everyone from wider field so theme is deliberately broad, but should still be specifically targeted at a key demographic.*\n\n*Red flags for event titles and themes can include:*\n\n* *does the event title have overly grandiose claims (ie 'world' or 'international')*\n* *is the title oddly close to another major event in your field*\n* *claim to be latest in a long series of the event, but no record of earflier event (or the same event is held multiple times in a single year so 14th event is only occurring 3 yrs after 1st event)*\n* *very broad, with no clear contribution or guiding theme/focus*\n* *does it reference multiple unrelated subject fields in the title (eg the International conference or mathematics, humanities and medicine)*\n"

      - title: COSTS
        content: >
          ### COSTS


          It is important when evaluating a conference to look at the charges
          and costs associated with attending and presenting at the conference.
          Consider whether the fees are reasonable in relation to what it costs
          the organiser to produce the event. Are they trying to make a high
          profit, or just using the conference fee to cover the actual costs of
          hosting the event? Does it feel like the organisers are only
          interested in generating high revenues, or is their central objective
          to host an event that makes a valuable contribution to your academic
          field?


          <CheckerQuestion question="are costs clear and transparent"
          answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are they reasonable (based on comparable

          way of monatizing"]} />

          answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          *Clear and reasonable costs, together discounts or bursaries for
          students and other low-income groups, and the option to pay lower
          charges by opting out of social and tourism activities, can indicate
          that the conference organiser is trying to make the event affordable
          and accessible – and is therefore not prioritizing revenue
          generation.*

      - title: SUBMISSION
        content: >
          ### SUBMISSION AND SELECTION


          There are a number of factors to consider when deciding whether or not
          to present your research at a particular conference. After all,
          typically a paper should contain new and original research that has
          not been published or presented previously – which means you only have
          one chance to present a particular piece of research, and you don’t
          want to waste it on a poor-quality conference.


          #### EVALUATION PROCESS


          When trying to determine whether a conference is predatory, there are
          two key red flags relating to the Call for Papers (CFP) process
          relating 1) to evaluation processes and 2) timelines. It takes time to
          review and assess proposals, and a good conference organiser will wait
          to receive all the proposals before issuing individual acceptances,
          and also allow suitable time for review by the scientific committee –
          because a good conference organiser wants the best possible collection
          of papers for their event.


          <CheckerQuestion question="Is there clarity about the applicant
          criteria" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="Is there a review process or is acceptance
          guaranteed? " answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="Is there clarity about the nature of the
          review process" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="Is there a fee to submit a proposal for
          consideration, or an extra fee for multiple authors"
          answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="Have you heard of any proposals rejected
          for this or a prior event by these organisers" answersList={["yes",
          "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="Are there clear deadlines for submission,
          review and acceptance" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are the deadlines suitably in advance of
          the event (multiple choice answers)" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are the response times for review too fast
          (multiple choice)" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are papers being accepted before the
          submission deadline" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          > *The structure and content of the Call for Papers (CFP) can be
          extremely useful when determining the quality of the conference. It
          should be clear, detailed and informative - outlining the unifying
          themes of the conference, key deadlines, review processes, and
          proposal requirements. Special panels, especially ones sponsored by
          external reputable organisations, are also a good credibility marker.*


          *When looking at the CFP, consider the following:*


          1. *is the CFP clear, well written and well structured*

          2. *Does the CFP contain all the key event details*

          3. *Does the CFP have a central unifying theme*

          4. *Does the CFP provide suggested topics which are clearly
          thematically aligned with each other and the overarching event topic
          or title*

          5. *Are these topics relevant for your research*

          6. *Does the CFP include information about requirements for proposal
          submissions (word count, author information and academic /
          professional credentials)*

          ### PROGRAMME


          Once the papers have been selected and the programme organised, you
          can use it to evaluate the quality and relevance of the conference,
          and decide whether to attend. Conferences cost money, so we usually
          look for full, well-rounded, and active programmes with lots of
          interesting papers which are not only relevant to the overarching
          event theme (and our own research area) but also delivered by
          researchers whose work we are familiar with.


          <CheckerQuestion question="is the programme sparse, with lots of
          breaks and poorly populated panels  " answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="is the programme well structured and
          relevant to the conference theme and subject field"
          answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="do multiple events appear to be occurring
          together" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are there lots of papers from seemingly
          unrelated disciplines" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="is the majority of the programme
          substantive or low-quality filler" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are there lots of sponsor / commercial
          speakers " answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="are the speakers from your field and
          adjacent fields related to conference topic" answersList={["yes",
          "no"]} />


          <CheckerQuestion question="can you corroborate identity and
          involvement of the speakers (do they mention involvement on their
          social media profiles)" answersList={["yes", "no"]} />


          *The nature and purpose of the conference helps to shape the type of
          programme created by the organisers - so it is important to identify
          what you want out of the conference when deciding whether to attend.*


          1. *An event designed to share research will have lots of individual
          presentations and parallel panels*

          2. *An event designed for networking and collaboration will be more
          focused on social opportunities and workshops*

          3. *An event focused on problem-solving might prioritise moderated
          panel discussions, workshops and breakout sessions.*


          *But remember, the topics under discussion and the presenters involved
          should always align with the conference theme and subject field.*


          *Also – if you have doubts, look at previous events in this series or
          by this organiser. How do those programmes look, and can you find
          online reviews or personal testimonials from anyone who has attended
          one of these events in the past?*
