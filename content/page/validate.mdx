              ### EVENT DISCOVERY SOURCE


              The first thing to consider when evaluating a conference is where
              and how it is

              promoted – and more importantly, how did you learn about it?

            _template: BB_CheckerQuestion

              If you or a colleague received an **unsolicited email** from a
              contact you do not know (ie not an email from a listserv or
              membership organisation you are registered with) this is a **huge
              red flag** and sign of a potentially predatory event.


              If you receive one of these emails and do not know the
              organisation or sender or cannot verify the existence of the
              organisation or individual sender, then this is concerning.
              Equally, if the organisation or individual sender are not actively
              producing research in the subject field of the event, or if the
              subject field of the event is not directly linked with your own
              research field, this is also a point of concern. Finally, be wary
              if there is a reference to a random (possibly unrelated) article
              you have published – as often predators find potential victims by
              collecting the contact details for corresponding authors from all
              recently published issues.


              So if you receive one of these emails, **consider the following:**


              * Can you **identify and verify the sender**, and are they
              actively producing research in your subject area?

              * Is the **event relevant** to their **subject** area and your
              own?

              * Is there is a **clear and convincing rationale** for you **to be
              contacted**?

              * Whether the email accurately highlights the **relevance of the
              event**  to your field of study

              * Is the email tone overly flattering?

              ### ORGANISER CREDIBILITY


              When evaluating a conference, it is important to consider the
              reputation of the conference organiser. Is the event organised by
              a reputable academic or professional institution, are you familiar
              with the individual organisers and their work, are you actually
              able to identify the organising institution and individual
              organisers, and are they active in the subject field related to
              the event?


              #### ORGANISER DETAILS


              While you wont always know everyone organising every conference in
              your field, it is important to be able to identify some key facts
              relating to the organisers, in order to ensure the event is

                is solely organised by a commercial entity it might indicate the
                event's purpose is generating money rather than advancing
                science. Therefore, it is important to still evaluate the event

              When evaluating the organising committee, it is not enough to just

              So if you have time, always try and check the following


              * do the individual members of the scientific committee exist and
              are the listed details correct (can you find their scholarly or
              professional profiles and do the details for job title and
              institution match those on the conference website)

              * have you heard of the scientific committee members before, is
              their work relevant to the event theme and subject field?

              * If the event is relevant for you, then hopefully the scientific
              committee’s work will also be relevant for you – have you heard of
              them or read their work before?

              * Do the individual members of the scientific committee confirm
              involvement with the conference (either by posting on their
              profiles or responding to direct enquiries)?

              #### EVENT THEME


              The theme and title of the conference should always be an
              important factor in your decision-making process. Part of this
              decision will be based on subjective factors, such as whether you
              think the event looks interesting and offers opportunities for you
              to learn relevant new developments in your field which align with
              your research. However there are also some objective factors
              related to the title and theme that can help you assess the
              legitimacy of the event.

              ### COSTS


              It is important when evaluating a conference to look at the
              charges and costs associated with attending and presenting at the
              conference. Consider whether the fees are reasonable in relation
              to what it costs the organiser to produce the event. Are they
              trying to make a high profit, or just using the conference fee to
              cover the actual costs of hosting the event? Does it feel like the
              organisers are only interested in generating high revenues, or is
              their central objective to host an event that makes a valuable
              contribution to your academic field?

              The structure and content of the Call for Papers (CFP) can be
              extremely useful when determining the quality of the conference.
              It should be clear, detailed and informative - outlining the
              unifying themes of the conference, key deadlines, review
              processes, and proposal requirements. Special panels, especially
              ones sponsored by external reputable organisations, are also a
              good credibility marker.


              When looking at the CFP, consider the following:


              1. is the CFP clear, well written and well structured

              2. Does the CFP contain all the key event details

              3. Does the CFP have a central unifying theme

              4. Does the CFP provide suggested topics which are clearly
              thematically aligned with each other and the overarching event
              topic or title

              5. Are these topics relevant for your research

              6. Does the CFP include information about requirements for
              proposal submissions (word count, author information and academic
              / professional credentials)

              When trying to determine whether a conference is predatory, there
              are two key red flags relating to the Call for Papers (CFP)
              process relating 1) to evaluation processes and 2) timelines. It
              takes time to review and assess proposals, and a good conference
              organiser will wait to receive all the proposals before issuing
              individual acceptances, and also allow suitable time for review by
              the scientific committee – because a good conference organiser
              wants the best possible collection of papers for their event.

              Once the papers have been selected and the programme organised,
              you can use it to evaluate the quality and relevance of the
              conference, and decide whether to attend. Conferences cost money,
              so we usually look for full, well-rounded, and active programmes
              with lots of interesting papers which are not only relevant to the
              overarching event theme (and our own research area) but also
              delivered by researchers whose work we are familiar with.

              The nature and purpose of the conference helps to shape the type
              of programme created by the organisers - so it is important to
              identify what you want out of the conference when deciding whether
              to attend.


              1. An event designed to share research will have lots of
              individual presentations and parallel panels

              2. An event designed for networking and collaboration will be more
              focused on social opportunities and workshops

              3. An event focused on problem-solving might prioritise moderated
              panel discussions, workshops and breakout sessions.


              But remember, the topics under discussion and the presenters
              involved should always align with the conference theme and subject
              field.


              Also – if you have doubts, look at previous events in this series
              or by this organiser. How do those programmes look, and can you
              find online reviews or personal testimonials from anyone who has
              attended one of these events in the past?

In addition, many universities will only provide funding support for faculty to attend conferences if they can guarantee to publish the conference paper. However, unfortunately predatory conference organisers often see publication as a way of extracting more money from researchers. Therefore, the way that the publication of the conference proceedings is mentioned can offer insights into the credibility of the conference organiser.\_\n"

              When considering the quality of a prospective publication or
              publisher, there are a number of factors you can consider when
              determining whether they are ethical, high quality and legitimate.


              ##### Factors to think about include


              * do you or trusted colleagues recognise the publication

              * have leading researchers in your field published in it

              * is the publication title aligned with your subject field and
              relevant to the conference theme

              * is the journal clear about its review and acceptance processes,
              and do these align with those outlined by the conference organsier

              * is the journal clear about publication fees, and do these align
              with those outlined by the conference organsier

              * does the publisher ensure long term archiving, indexing and
              comprehensive metadata (to ensure global discoverability and
              visibility)


              For a more detailed investigation of journal credibility and
              legitimacy, the [Think.Check.Submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/
              "Think.Check.Submit") checklist is a valuable online tool which is
              free to use.
