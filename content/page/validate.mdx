          The first thing to consider when evaluating a conference is where and
          how it is

          promoted – and more importantly, how did you learn about it?


          <CheckerQuestion answersList={["friends or colleagues informed me|5",
          "I saw a paid advert online|2", "social media timeline|2", "mentioned
          by a trusted organisation|2", "mentioned by a trusted social media
          account|1", "listserve notification / member's organisation

          a stranger|-5"]} isCheckbox={true} question="How did you hear about
          the event?" />


          1\. How did you hear about the event \[multiple choice


          If you or a colleague received an unsolicited email from a contact you
          do not know

          (ie not an email from a listserv or membership organisation you are
          registered with)

          this is a huge red flag and sign of a potentially predatory event.

          If you receive one of these emails and do not know the organisation or
          sender or

          cannot verify the existence of the organisation or individual sender,
          then this is

          concerning. Equally, if the organisation or individual sender are not
          actively

          producing research in the subject field of the event, or if the
          subject field of the

          event is not directly linked with your own research field, this is
          also a point of

          concern. Finally, be wary if there is a reference to a random
          (possibly unrelated)

          article you have published – as often predators find potential victims
          by collecting

          the contact details for corresponding authors from all recently
          published issues.

          So if you receive one of these emails, consider the following:


          * Can you identify and verify the sender, and are they actively
          producing research in your subject area?

          * Is the event relevant to their subject area and your own?

          * Is there is a clear and convincing rationale for you to be
          contacted?

          * Whether the email accurately highlights the relevance of the event
          to your field of study Is the email tone overly flattering?
      - title: ORGANISER CREDIBILITY
        content: "When evaluating a conference, it is important to consider the reputation of the\nconference organiser. Is the event organised by a reputable academic or\nprofessional institution, are you familiar with the individual organisers and their\nwork, are you actually able to identify the organising institution and individual\norganisers, and are they active in the subject field related to the event?\n\n#### ORGANISER DETAILS\n\nWhile you wont always know everyone organising every conference in your field, it\nis important to be able to identify some key facts relating to the organisers, in order\nto ensure the event is legitimate.\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Can you verify that the organising institution and main organiser actually exist\" answersList={[\"yes\", \"no\"]} />\n\n<CheckerQuestion question=\"Can you identify the organising institution(s) or company/iesa.

Sometimes predatory organisers make up names, make up institutions, or even steal legitimate names and put them on the website without the permission of these scholars. So if you have time, always try and check the following:*\n"
      - title: EVENT CREDIBILITY
        content: "When considering whether to attend an event, in addition to the event’s relevance to you and alignment with your own research interests, it is important to also think about the legitimacy and quality. Does it seem like the key motivation and purpose for organising the conference is to advance knowledge or make money, can you easily identify partners and venues, and is there transparency about funding sources?\_\n\n#### EVENT DETAILS\n\n1. can you identify the venue, and confirm its existence\n2. can you find mentions of the event elsewhere by other organisations and individuals (on social media and personal websites)\n3. can you clearly identify event partners and sponsors\_\n4. can you clearly identify event funders and hosts\n5. have you heard of (3) and (4), and is it logical they would be involved with an event in this subject field\n"
      - title: COSTS
        content: >
          It is important when evaluating a conference to look at the charges
          and costs associated with attending and presenting at the conference.
          Consider whether the fees are reasonable in relation to what it costs
          the organiser to produce the event. Are they trying to make a high
          profit, or just using the conference fee to cover the actual costs of
          hosting the event? Does it feel like the organisers are only
          interested in generating high revenues, or is their central objective
          to host an event that makes a valuable contribution to your academic
          field?
      - title: SUBMISSION AND SELECTION
        content: "Once the papers have been selected and the programme organised, you can use it to evaluate the quality and relevance of the conference, and decide whether to attend. Conferences cost money, so we usually look for full, well-rounded, and active programmes with lots of interesting papers which are not only relevant to the overarching event theme (and our own research area) but also delivered by researchers whose work we are familiar with.\_\n"
