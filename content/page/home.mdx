      ## **Our mission**


      ##### Think. Check. Attend. is an initiative that aims to guide and assist
      researchers and scholars to judge the legitimacy and academic credentials
      of conferences in order to help them decide whether to or not attend the
      same. Nowadays, the scholarly community faces an increasing number of
      invitations to present at or attend conferences. Some of these are
      respectable, academic events, while others are misleading, exaggerated or
      even fake.


      Think. Check. Attend. provides guidelines that help researchers to
      differentiate between an authentic conference and the one they should
      avoid. In this initiative, we help scholars to recognise the
      characteristics of a trusted conference to attend and submit their
      abstracts through a number of steps and a check list. Simply follow these
      steps and you will rest assured that you attend only the most appropriate
      conferences.

          Is it the right conference to attend and present your research? Are
          you submitting your abstract to a trusted conference?


          * New conferences are announced each year.

          * Stories of questionable and fake conferences are also on the rise.

          * It can be challenging to find up-to-date guidance when choosing the
          right conference to attend.

          * How can you be sure the conference you are considering is the right
          conference to attend and present your research?

          This check list provides guidance on trusting a conference to attend
          and present your research.


          * Are you aware of the society or the association organizing this
          conference?

          * Can you easily identify the venue of the conference?

          * Is it the first time that this conference is being held?

          * Have you or your colleagues attended this conference before?

          * Is it clear what fees will be charged (conference fee, registration
          fees, …, etc.) and would these be waived if you are accepted as a
          speaker?

          Complete the check list and attend the conference or submit your
          abstract only if you are satisfied and you can answer ‘yes’ to most or
          all of the questions.


          * Attending the right conference will give you the opportunity to
          maintain your awareness of the latest updates and improvements in your
          field.

          * Attending the right conference will enhance your career and expand
          your connections within the academic community.

          * Publishing your Conference Paper under a professional publishing
          experience, where your work is reviewed, edited, indexed and easily
          discoverable will enhance your reputation and your chance of gaining
          citations.

          * Only then should you attend and present your research at this
          conference.

      ![](/uploads/tcs.png)


      Think Check Submit is a global campaign to help researchers identify
      trusted journals for their research. It is a simple checklist that
      researchers can use to assess the credentials of a journal or a publisher.
      The campaign has been produced with the support of a coalition from across
      the scholarly communications community in response to discussions about
      deceptive publishing.
