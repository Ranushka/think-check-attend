      ## **Our mission**


      ##### Think. Check. Attend. is an initiative that aims to guide and assist
      researchers and scholars to judge the legitimacy and academic credentials
      of conferences in order to help them decide whether to or not attend the
      same. Nowadays, the scholarly community faces an increasing number of
      invitations to present at or attend conferences. Some of these are
      respectable, academic events, while others are misleading, exaggerated or
      even fake.


      Think. Check. Attend. provides guidelines that help researchers to
      differentiate between an authentic conference and the one they should
      avoid. In this initiative, we help scholars to recognise the
      characteristics of a trusted conference to attend and submit their
      abstracts through a number of steps and a check list. Simply follow these
      steps and you will rest assured that you attend only the most appropriate
      conferences.
